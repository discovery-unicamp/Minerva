                the layer in the model and the second being the name of the
                layer in the ExtractedModel. In this case, the names of the

                layers, which is particularly useful when we want to repeat
                non-trainable layers, such as normalization, pooling, and
                activation layers.

            - A dictionary with the keys being the names of the layers in the
                model and the values being the names of the layers in the
                ExtractedModel. In this case, the names of the layers in the

        Notes
        -----
            - The name of layers to be extracted can be a regular expression.

                layers parameter or in the dictionary keys.


        Raises
        ------
