# Models

The models module is a collection of models that can be used for various tasks. I has two main submodules: `nets` and `ssl`. The `nets` submodule contains architectures for neural networks that can be trained in a supervised manner. The `ssl` submodule contains implementations of semi-supervised learning techniques, usually requiring a architecture from the `nets` submodule to run.

Both `nets` and `ssl` submodules are further divided into areas of use (e.g. `image` and `time_series`). This division is made to make it easier to find the right model for the right task. It's not uncommon for a model to be used in more than one area of use, in that case it will be in the main area of use in it's original paper.

In the case of a architecture or semi-supervised learning technique been agnostic to the type of data, it will be in the root of the submodule.

## Nets

These are the models implemented in the `nets` submodule:
