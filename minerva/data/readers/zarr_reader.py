        Parameters
        ----------
        path : PathLike
            Path to the Zarr array.
        Notes
        -----
        1.  The Zarr array is expected to be stored on disk. If the array is not
            stored on disk, it is recommended to use the `PatchedArrayReader`
            class instead.

        2.  When using padding, the padding is applied to the entire array. This
            will load the entire array into memory. If the array is too large to
            fit into memory, it is recommended to pad before.
            See `LazyPaddedPatchedZarrReader` for an a lazy alternative.

        Examples
        ---------

        ```python
        >>> from pathlib import Path
        >>> data_path = Path("data.zarr")
        >>> reader = PatchedZarrReader(
        ...     path=data_path,
        ...     data_shape=(5, 5),
        ...     stride=(2, 5),
        ... )
        >>> print(len(reader))
        >>> print(reader[0])

        """

        self.path = path
        data = zarr.open(path)
