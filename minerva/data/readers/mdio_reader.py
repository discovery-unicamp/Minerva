        Parameters
        ----------
        path : PathLike
            Path to the MDIO array.
        mdio_data: str
            Name of data array inside MDIO subdirectory. Defaults to 'data/chunked_012'
        Notes
        -----
        1.  The MDIO array is expected to be stored on disk. If the array is not
            stored on disk, it is recommended to use the `PatchedArrayReader`
            class instead.

        2.  When using padding, the padding is applied to the entire array. This
            will load the entire array into memory. If the array is too large to
            fit into memory, it is recommended to pad before.
            See `LazyPaddedPatchedMDIOReader` for an a lazy alternative.

        Examples
        ---------

        ```python
        >>> from pathlib import Path
        >>> data_path = Path("data.mdio")
        >>> reader = PatchedMDIOReader(
        ...     path=data_path,
        ...     data_shape=(5, 5),
        ...     stride=(2, 5),
        ... )
        >>> print(len(reader))
        >>> print(reader[0])
