# Contributing to Minerva

## Introduction

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the project. It's people like you that make Minerva such a great tool.

Following the guidelines ensures that your contribution will be considered by the maintainers. It also helps you know what to expect from the project maintainers in return. The guidelines exist to help all of us work together in a more efficient way, creating a common language that we can all understand.

Minerva is a tool that is constantly evolving, and we are always looking for ways to improve it. We are looking for contributions in bug fixes, new features, tests and documentation improvements. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.

## Ground Rules

First of all, make sure to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/discovery-unicamp/Minerva/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and be respectful to all contributors and community members.

### Issues

* **Bug reports** should be as detailed as possible. Include the steps to reproduce the bug, the expected behavior and the actual behavior. If possible, include screenshots. There is a template available for bug reports. You should follow it as closely as possible.
* **Feature requests** should be more concise. Include the problem you are facing, the solution you are thinking about and any other information that you think is relevant. There is also a template available for feature requests you should follow as close as possible.

Any other discussion should be done in the [Discussions](https://github.com/discovery-unicamp/Minerva/discussions) tab.

### Pull Requests

* **Code changes** should be tested and documented. If you are adding a new feature, make sure to include tests for it. If you are fixing a bug, make sure to include a test that reproduces the bug when possible.
* **Commit messages** should be clear and concise. If you are fixing a bug, include the issue number in the commit message. If you are adding a new feature, include a brief description of it.

## Getting started

For changes bigger than one or two line fix:

1. Create a new fork for your changes
2. Make the changes needed in this fork
3. If you are ready to merge your code to the main make sure that:
   1. You wrote tests for your changes
   2. All tests pass, new and old
   3. Your code is well documented
4. Make your PR

Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough don't need to be made from another fork.

As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:

* Spelling / grammar fixes
* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
* Comment clean up
* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
* Adding logging messages or debugging output
* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
* Moving source files from one directory or package to another

## How to report a bug

### Security Vulnerabilities

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Contact one of the core maintainers privately or email <edson@ic.unicamp.br> instead.

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:

* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just contact us.

### Other Bug Reports

You can even include a template so people can just copy-paste (again, less work for you).

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of Python are you using?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

Other than these questions, if you think any other information may be useful feel free to include it.

General questions should go to the [Discussions](https://github.com/discovery-unicamp/Minerva/discussions) tab instead of the issue tracker. The community there will answer or ask you to file an issue if you've tripped over a bug.

## How to suggest a feature or enhancement

One of our philosophies is to implement the least redundant features possible, without making our dependencies bloated. So, if there is a function within the scope of one of our dependencies that already solves what you are trying to implement you should prioritize it.

Furthermore ...

### Explain your desired process for suggesting a feature

If there is back-and-forth or signoff required, say so. Ask them to scope the feature, thinking through why it’s needed and how it might work.

> If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in Elasticsearch, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that Elasticsearch has today have been added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

## Code review process

### Explain how a contribution gets accepted after it’s been submitted.
Who reviews it? Who needs to sign off before it’s accepted? When should a contributor expect to hear from you? How can contributors get commit access, if at all?

> The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis in a weekly triage meeting that we hold in a public Google Hangout. The hangout is announced in the weekly status updates that are sent to the puppet-dev list. Notes are posted to the Puppet Community community-triage repo and include a link to a YouTube recording of the hangout.
> After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

## Community
If there are other channels you use besides GitHub to discuss contributions, mention them here. You can also list the author, maintainers, and/or contributors here, or set expectations for response time.

> You can chat with the core team on https://gitter.im/cucumber/cucumber. We try to have office hours on Fridays.

## BONUS: Code, commit message and labeling conventions
These sections are not necessary, but can help streamline the contributions you receive.

### Explain your preferred style for code, if you have any.
