.. py:class:: BalancedAccuracy(num_classes, task, adjusted = False)

   Bases: :py:obj:`torchmetrics.Metric`


   Base class for all metrics present in the Metrics API.

   This class is inherited by all metrics and implements the following functionality:

       1. Handles the transfer of metric states to the correct device.
       2. Handles the synchronization of metric states across processes.
       3. Provides properties and methods to control the overall behavior of the metric and its states.

   The three core methods of the base class are: ``add_state()``, ``forward()`` and ``reset()`` which should almost
   never be overwritten by child classes. Instead, the following methods should be overwritten ``update()`` and
   ``compute()``.

   Args:
       kwargs: additional keyword arguments, see :ref:`Metric kwargs` for more info.

           - **compute_on_cpu**:
               If metric state should be stored on CPU during computations. Only works for list states.
           - **dist_sync_on_step**:
               If metric state should synchronize on ``forward()``. Default is ``False``.
           - **process_group**:
               The process group on which the synchronization is called. Default is the world.
           - **dist_sync_fn**:
               Function that performs the allgather option on the metric state. Default is a custom
               implementation that calls ``torch.distributed.all_gather`` internally.
           - **distributed_available_fn**:
               Function that checks if the distributed backend is available. Defaults to a
               check of ``torch.distributed.is_available()`` and ``torch.distributed.is_initialized()``.
           - **sync_on_compute**:
               If metric state should synchronize when ``compute`` is called. Default is ``True``.
           - **compute_with_cache**:
               If results from ``compute`` should be cached. Default is ``True``.


   Compute the balanced accuracy.

   The balanced accuracy in binary, multiclass, and multilabel classification problems
   deals with imbalanced datasets. It is defined as the average of recall obtained on each class.

   Parameters
   ----------
   num_classes : int
       The number of classes in the target data.

   task : str
       The type of classification task, should be one of 'binary' or 'multiclass'

   adjusted : bool, optional (default=False)
       When true, the result is adjusted for chance, so that random performance would score 0,
       while keeping perfect performance at a score of 1.

   Attributes
   ----------
   confmat : torch.Tensor
       Confusion matrix to keep track of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

   Examples
   --------
   >>> y_true = torch.tensor([0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0])
   >>> y_pred = torch.tensor([0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1])
   >>> metric = BalancedAccuracy(num_classes=2, task='binary')
   >>> metric(y_pred, y_true)
   0.625
