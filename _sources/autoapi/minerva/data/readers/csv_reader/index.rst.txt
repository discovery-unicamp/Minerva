   Bases: :py:obj:`minerva.data.readers.tabular_reader.TabularReader`


   Base class for readers. Readers define an ordered collection of data and
   provide methods to access it. This class primarily handles:

   1. Definition of data structure and storage.
   2. Reading data from the source.

   The access is handled by the __getitem__ and __len__ methods, which should be
   implemented by a subclass. Readers usually returns a single item at a time,
   that can be a single image, a single label, etc.

   Reader to select columns from a DataFrame and return them as a NumPy
   array. The DataFrame is indexed by the row number. Each row of the
   DataFrame is considered as a sample. Thus, the __getitem__ method will
   return the columns of the DataFrame at the specified index as a NumPy
   array.

   Parameters
   ----------
   df : pd.DataFrame
       The DataFrame to select the columns from. The DataFrame should have
       the columns that are specified in the `columns_to_select` parameter.
   columns_to_select : Union[str, list[str]]
       A string or a list of strings used to select the columns from the
       DataFrame. The string can be a regular expression pattern or a
       column name. The columns that match the pattern will be selected.
       Note that if columns_to_select is a list, the result is always a
       numpy array with the columns in the same order as the list.
       If the columns_to_select is a string, the result is a numpy array
       if the selected columns are more than one, otherwise it is a single
       value (which is not a numpy array).
   cast_to : str, optional
       Cast the selected columns to the specified data type. If None, the
       data type of the columns will not be changed. (default is None)
   data_shape : tuple[int, ...], optional
       The shape of the data to be returned. If None, the data will be
       returned as a 1D array. If provided, the data will be reshaped to
       the specified shape. (default is None)
