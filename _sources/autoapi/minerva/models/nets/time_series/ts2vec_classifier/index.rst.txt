   Bases: :py:obj:`minerva.models.nets.base.SimpleSupervisedModel`


   A modular Lightning model wrapper for supervised learning tasks.

   This class enables the construction of supervised models by combining a
   backbone (feature extractor), an optional adapter, and a fully connected
   (FC) head. It provides a clean interface for setting up custom training,
   validation, and testing pipelines with pluggable loss functions, metrics,
   optimizers, and learning rate schedulers.

   The architecture is structured as follows:

       +------------------+
       |  Backbone Model  |
       +------------------+
               |
               v
       +------------------------+
       |  Adapter (Optional)    |
       +------------------------+
               |
        (Flatten if needed)
               v
       +------------------------+
       |  Fully Connected Head  |
       +------------------------+
               |
               v
       +------------------+
       |  Loss Function   |
       +------------------+

   Training and validation steps comprise the following steps:

   1. Forward pass input through the backbone.
   2. Pass through adapter (if provided).
   3. Flatten the output (if `flatten` is True) before the FC head.
   4. Forward through the FC head.
   5. Compute loss with respect to targets.
   6. Backpropagate and update parameters.
   7. Compute metrics and log them.
   8. Return loss. `train_loss`, `val_loss`, and `test_loss` are always
      logged, along with any additional metrics specified in the
      `train_metrics`, `val_metrics`, and `test_metrics` dictionaries.

   This wrapper is especially useful to quickly set up supervised models for
   various tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and
   segmentation. It is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing users
   to easily swap out components like the backbone, adapter, and FC head as
   needed. The model is built with a focus on simplicity and modularity, making
   it easy to adapt to different use cases and requirements.
   The model is designed to be used with PyTorch Lightning and is compatible
   with its training loop.

   **Note**: For more complex architectures that does not follow the above
   structure should not inherit from this class.

   **Note**: Input batches must be tuples (input_tensor, target_tensor).

   Initializes the supervised model with training components and configs.

   Parameters
   ----------
   backbone : torch.nn.Module or LoadableModule
       The backbone (feature extractor) model.
   fc : torch.nn.Module or LoadableModule
       The fully connected head. Use nn.Identity() if not required.
   loss_fn : torch.nn.Module
       Loss function to optimize during training.
   adapter : Callable, optional
       Function to transform backbone outputs before feeding into `fc`.
   learning_rate : float, default=1e-3
       Learning rate used for optimization.
   flatten : bool, default=True
       If True, flattens backbone outputs before `fc`.
   train_metrics : dict, optional
       TorchMetrics dictionary for training evaluation.
   val_metrics : dict, optional
       TorchMetrics dictionary for validation evaluation.
   test_metrics : dict, optional
       TorchMetrics dictionary for test evaluation.
   freeze_backbone : bool, default=False
       If True, backbone parameters are frozen during training.
   optimizer: type
       Optimizer class to be instantiated. By default, it is set to
       `torch.optim.Adam`. Should be a subclass of
       `torch.optim.Optimizer` (e.g., `torch.optim.SGD`).
   optimizer_kwargs : dict, optional
       Additional kwargs passed to the optimizer constructor.
   lr_scheduler : type, optional
       Learning rate scheduler class to be instantiated. By default, it is
       set to None, which means no scheduler will be used. Should be a
       subclass of `torch.optim.lr_scheduler.LRScheduler` (e.g.,
       `torch.optim.lr_scheduler.StepLR`).
   lr_scheduler_kwargs : dict, optional
       Additional kwargs passed to the scheduler constructor.


   .. py:method:: _calculate_fc_input_features(backbone, input_shape)

      Run a single forward pass with a random input to get the number of
      features after the convolutional layers.

      Parameters
      ----------
      backbone : torch.nn.Module
          The backbone of the network
      input_shape : Tuple[int, int, int]
          The input shape of the network.

      Returns
      -------
      int
          The number of features after the convolutional layers.
